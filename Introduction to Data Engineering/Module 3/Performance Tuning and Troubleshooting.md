# Introduction
---
One of the key responsibilities of a Data Engineer is to monitor and optimize systems and data flows for **performance** and **availability**.

# Data Pipeline
---
A [[ETL, ELT & Data Pipelines#Data Pipelines|data pipeline]] typically runs with a combination of complex tools and ca face several different types of performance threats, Like:
- Scalability in the face of increasing data sets and workloads.
- Application failures.
- Scheduled jobs not functioning accurately.
- Tool incompatibilities.

## Performance Metrics
---
**Latency** - The time it takes for a service to fulfill a request.

**Failures** - The rate at which a service fails.

Resource **Utilization** and utilization patterns.

**Traffic** - Number of user requests received in a give period.

## Troubleshooting
---
**Collect information** about the incident to ascertain if observed behavior is an issue. ( The issue could have been reported by a user or flagged during a maintenance check)

Check if you're working with all the **right versions** of software and source codes.

Check the **logs and metrics** early on in your troubleshooting process to isolate whether an issue is related to the infrastructure, data, software, or a combination of these.

**Reproduce the issue** in a test environment. This can be an iterative and time-consuming process.

# Database Optimization for Performance
---
**Performance Metrics for Databases:**
- System outages.
- Capacity utilization.
- Application slowdown.
- Performance of queries.
- Conflicting activities and queries being executed simultaneously.
- Batch activities causing resource constraints.

**Capacity Planning** - Determining the optimal hardware and software resources required for performance.

**Database Indexing** - Locating data without searching each row in a database resulting in faster querying.

**Database Partitioning** - Dividing large tables into smaller individual tables, improving performance and data manageability.

**Database Normalization** - Reducing inconsistencies arising out of data redundancy and anomalies arising out of update, delete, and insert operations on databases.

# Monitoring Systems
---
Monitoring and alerting systems help us collect quantitative data about our systems and applications in real time.
Theses systems gives visibility into the performance of the data pipelines, data platforms, databases, applications, tools, queries, scheduled jobs, and more.

**Database Monitoring Tools** take frequent snapshots of the performance indicators of a database. This helps to:
- Track when and how a problem started to occur.
- Isolate and get to the root of the issue.

**Application Performance Management Tools** measure and monitor the performance of applications and amount of resources utilized by each process. This helps in proactive allocation of resources to improve application performance.

**Tools for Monitoring Query Performance** gather statistics about query throughput, execution, performance, resource utilization and utilization patterns for better planning and allocation of resources.

**Job-level Runtime Monitoring** breaks up a job into a series of logical steps which are monitored for completion and time to completion.

**Monitoring Amount of Data being Processed** through a data pipeline helps to asses if size of workload is slowing down the system.

# Maintenance Schedules
---
Preventive maintenance routines generate data that we can use to identify systems and procedures responsible for faults and low availability.

These routines can be:
- **Time-based** - Planned as scheduled activities at pre-fixed time intervals.
- **Condition-based** - Performed when there is a specific issue or a decrease in performance.
