# Introduction
## 1. Query Languages:

<div class="definition" >
	<span style="font-weight:bold">Definition:</span> Designed for accessing and manipulating data in a database (SQL)
</div>

### SQL <span style="color:lightgreen">(Most Popular) </span>
Structured Query Language, is a querying language designed for accessing and manipulating information from, mostly, though not exclusively, relational databases.

**Using SQL, you can:**
- insert, update, and delete records in a database
- Create new databases, tables and views

**Advantages:**
- SQL is portable and platform independent.
- Can be used for querying data in a wide variety of databases and repositories
- Has a simple syntax that is similar to English language.
- Its syntax allows developers to write programs with fewer lines of code using basic keywords
- can retrieve large amounts of data quickly and efficiently.
- Runs on a <span style="color:lightblue">interpreter system.</span> [^1]

## 2. Programming Languages:

**Definition:** Designed for developing application and controlling application behavior (Python, R)

### Python
Python is a widely-used open-source, general-purpose, high-level programming language. Its syntax allows programmers to express their concepts in fewer lines of code, as compared to some of the older languages.

- Its syntax allows programmers to express their concepts in fewer lines of code, as compared to some of the older languages.
- An ideal tool for beginning programmers because of its focus on simplicity and readability
- Great for performing high-computational tasks in large volumes
- Has in-built functions for frequently used concepts
- Supports multiple programming paradigms - object oriented, imperative, functional and procedural

#### Useful Libraries for data engineering

| Name                   | Use                                                                        |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Pandas                 | For Data cleaning and analysis                                             |
| Numpy & Scipy          | for Statistical analysis                                                   |
| BeautifulSoup & Scrapy | for web scraping                                                           |
| Matplotlib & Seaborn   | visually represent data in the form of bar graphs, histogram and pie-chart |
| Opency                 | for image processing                                                       |

### R
R is an open-source programming language and environment for data analysis, data visualization, machine learning, and statistics. <span style="color:red"> can be paired with many programming languages like python </span>

**Widely used for:**
- Developing statistical software
- Performing data analytics
- Creating compelling visualizations

### Java
Java is an object-oriented, class-based, and platform-independent programming language. It was originally developed by Sun Microsystems and is now widely used in various applications and industries.

**Key points:**
- Used in number of <span style="color:blue">analytics processes </span> [^2]
- Used in development of big data frameworks and tools like <span style="color:lightblue">Hadoop, Hive, Spark </span>
- Well suited for <span style=" text-decoration:underline; color:red;"> speed-critical projects </span>

## 3. Shell and Scripting Languages:

**Definition:** Ideal for repetitive and time-consuming operational tasks (Unix/Linux Shell, PowerShell).

### Unix/Linux Shell

[^1]: An interpreter system is a software program that translates and executes code line by line. It reads the code, interprets each line, and immediately executes it. This allows developers to see the results of their code in real-time without the need for compilation. Interpreted languages, such as Python and JavaScript, use interpreter systems to run code.
