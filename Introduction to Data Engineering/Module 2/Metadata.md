## Technical metadata
---
Technical metadata is metadata which defines the data structures in data repositories or platforms, primarily from a technical perspective.

For example, technical metadata in a data warehouse includes assets such as:

- Tables that record information about the tables stored in a database, like:
    
    - each table's name
    - the number of columns and rows each table has
- A data catalog, which is an inventory of tables that contain information, like:
    
    - the name of each database in the enteprise data warehouse
    - the name of each column present in each database
    - the names of every table that each column is contained in
    - the type of data that each column contains

The technical metadata for relational databases is typically stored in specialized tables in the database called the System Catalog.
